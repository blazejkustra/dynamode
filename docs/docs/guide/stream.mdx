# Stream

The `Stream` class is designed to process [DynamoDB streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html#Streams.Enabling) and convert them into corresponding Dynamode entity instances. 

This simplifies the process of handling DynamoDB streams and allows you to work with Dynamode entities directly.

:::info
DynamoDB streams of type `KEYS_ONLY` are not supported in Dynamode.
:::

## Stream constructor - new Stream(Entity)

Every stream has to be initialized with data from a DynamoDB stream record. The `Stream` class constructor takes a DynamoDB [`Record`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_streams_Record.html) and initializes a `Stream` instance.

```ts
import Stream from 'dynamode/stream';

const stream = new Stream(dynamoDBRecord);
```

## Stream properties

The `Stream` class has the following properties:
- `streamType`: The type of the stream. It can be one of the following: `newImage`, `oldImage`, or `both`.
- `operation`: The operation that was performed on the entity. It can be one of the following: `insert`, `modify`, or `remove`.
- `newImage`: The new entity image after the operation. Instance of the [entity](/docs/guide/entity/modeling) class.
- `oldImage`: The old entity image before the operation. Instance of the [entity](/docs/guide/entity/modeling) class.
- `entity`: The entity class that the stream corresponds to.

## stream.isEntity(entity)

### Description

A method to check if the stream entity corresponds to the provided entity class. It also narrows down the type of the stream entity to the provided entity class.

### Arguments

`entity: Entity`: The entity class you want to check the stream entity against.

### Returns

Returns `true` if it's the same entity type, otherwise `false`.

### Examples

Let's say you have a stream that you want to check if it corresponds to the [`User`](/docs/guide/entity/modeling#user) entity. This way you can easily check if the stream entity is a `User` entity and work with it accordingly.

```ts
const stream = new Stream(dynamoDBRecord);

// Check that the stream refers to the User entity
if (stream.isEntity(User)) { 
  // images are narrowed down here (Stream<Entity> -> Stream<User>)
  const newUser = stream.newImage;
  const oldUser = stream.oldImage;
  
  // Do logic based on custom logic
  if(oldUser.username !== newUser.username && newUser.age > 18) {
    // Do something
  }
}
```

## Support for `aws-lambda`

The `Stream` class is designed to work with AWS Lambda functions that process DynamoDB streams. Here is an example of how you can use the `Stream` class in a Lambda function.

```ts
import type { Context, DynamoDBStreamEvent } from 'aws-lambda';
import Stream from 'dynamode/stream';

async function itemStream(event: DynamoDBStreamEvent, context: Context): void {
  const stream = new Stream(event.Records[0]);

  // Update list progress when an item is created
  if (stream.isEntity(List)) {
    if (stream.operation === 'insert' && stream.newImage) {
      await ListManager.update(List.getPrimaryKey(stream.newImage.listId), {
        increment: {
          'progress.checked': 1,
        },
      });
    }
  }
}
```
