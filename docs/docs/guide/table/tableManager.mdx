# Table Manager
`Entity` takes one argument `tableName: string` which defines the table in which the model will be saved. It also takes a generic type which describes primary key and secondary index keys. Dynamode uses this type in all underlying methods so be cautious when setting it up. 

```ts
type Keys = {
  partitionKey: 'keyPk';
  sortKey?: 'keySk';
  indexes?: {
    [indexName: string]: {
      partitionKey?: 'indexKeyPk';
      sortKey?: 'indexKeySk';
    };
  }
};
```
