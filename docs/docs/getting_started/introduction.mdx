## About Dynamode

Dynamode is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Its goal is to ease the use of DynamoDB without its quirks and emphasize DynamoDB advantages over other databases.

Dynamode provides a straightforward, object-oriented class-based solution to model your data. It includes strongly typed classes and methods, query and scan builders, and much more.

Dynamode is highly influenced by other ORMs/ODMs, such as [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm), [Dynamoose](https://github.com/dynamoose/dynamoose) and [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose).
