# Introduction

## About Dynamode

Dynamode is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Its goal is to ease the use of DynamoDB without its quirks and emphasize DynamoDB advantages over other databases.

Dynamode provides a straightforward, object-oriented class-based solution to model your data. It includes strongly typed classes and methods, query and scan builders, and much more.

Dynamode is highly influenced by other ORMs/ODMs, such as [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm), [Dynamoose](https://github.com/dynamoose/dynamoose) and [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose).

## Features

- Strongly typed
- Easy to use with elegant-syntax
- High level API
- Clean object oriented model
- DynamoDB single table design support
- Powerful query, scan and conditions builder
- AWS multi-region support
- DynamoDB transactions support

## Coming soon

- Logging
- Migrations and automatic migrations generation.
- DynamoDB streams support
- E2e tests
- PartiQL support
- Capture DynamoDB errors and make it easier to work with
- Support binary data type

## TODOs

* [x] Table creation
* [x] Table validation/update (e.g. local secondary indexes can be added only on tables with composite primary keys)
* [ ] Fix issue using Entity.update (empty set and string are not allowed https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html)
* [ ] Validation to query/scan classes
* [ ] Validation to make sure that entities are registered have partitionKey and other stuff
* [ ] Fix Condition, Query and Scan methods to work only on specific properties (between, contains etc shouldn't work for array as an example)
* [ ] Improve error messages
* [ ] Write e2e tests

### Other
  
* [ ] Add DynamoDB streams support
* [ ] Implement query that support querying different types of entities at once with TS support
* [ ] Possibility to have more than one suffix/prefix
* [ ] Decide if batchPut should return items when unprocessed items are returned
* [ ] Support binary types [link](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/blob/06417909a3/packages/util-dynamodb/src/convertToAttr.ts#L166) and [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/modules/_aws_sdk_util_dynamodb.html)
* [ ] Logging possibility
* [ ] PartiQL support
* [ ] Add dependsOn decorator to throw/warn when updating
* [ ] Allow multiple DynamoDB instances
* [ ] Capture DynamoDB errors and make it easier to work with
