# Quick Start

## Installation

First be sure to have Node.js installed, initialize a new project with `npm init`. Next install Dynamode by running the following command.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```bash
npm install dynamode
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add dynamode
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add dynamode
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setting up DynamoDB 

To setup DynamoDB locally use the following [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html). This way you can test your application without incurring any costs.

## Connect to DynamoDB

At the top of your file, import Dynamode and connect to local DynamoDB instance.

```ts
import Dynamode from 'dynamode/dynamode';

Dynamode.ddb.local();
```

In a real-world scenario, you would authenticate with AWS. For more information, check out the [Configure](/docs/getting_started/configure#authenticate-programmatically) section. 

:::info
Always authenticate at the top/beginning of your application.

## Create a table

With Dynamode, everything is derived from an [Entity](/docs/guide/entity/modeling#modeling-with-typescript). Let's import it and define our table with a [composite primary key](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/primary-key-dynamodb-table). 

:::caution
In case you are using TypeScript, you need to add following lines in `tsconfig.json` in order to use decorators:

```ts
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    ...
  }
}
```
:::


```ts
import attribute from 'dynamode/decorators';
import Entity from 'dynamode/entity';

export default class Table extends Entity {
  @attribute.partitionKey.string()
  pk: string;

  @attribute.sortKey.string()
  sk: string;

  constructor(props: { pk: string; sk: string; }) {
    super(props);

    this.pk = props.pk;
    this.sk = props.sk;
  }
}

```

Every attribute you want to save in database should be defined as a class property with the `@attribute` decorator. You can read more about it [here](/docs/guide/entity/decorators). 

Now, let's initialize a [table manager](/docs/guide/managers/tableManager) that will allow us to create the table in DynamoDB.

```ts
import TableManager from 'dynamode/table';

const FirstTableManager = new TableManager(Table, {
  tableName: 'TABLE_NAME',
  partitionKey: 'pk', // attribute that will be used as the partition key
  sortKey: 'sk', // attribute that will be used as the sort key
});
```

You can create the table by running the following command. 

```ts
await FirstTableManager.createTable();
```

:::info
You only need to run this command once.
:::

## Create your model

Let's say we like kittens and want to record every kitten we ever meet. In order to create a model for our kitten, we will create a class that extends the `Table` class. You can add any methods you want to this class, and use later on.

```ts
class Kitten extends Table {
  @attribute.string()
  name: string;

  constructor(props: { pk: string; sk: string; name: string }) {
    super(props);

    this.name = props.name;
  }

  speak() {
    return `Meow, my name is ${this.name}!`;
  }
}
```

A model is a class with which we construct items. In this case, each item will be a kitten with properties and behaviors as declared in our class. Let's create a kitten item representing the little guy we just met on the sidewalk outside:

```ts
const fluffball = new Kitten({ 
    pk:'kitten', 
    sk:'fluffball', 
    name: 'Fluffball' 
  });
console.log(fluffball.name); // 'Fluffball'
console.log(fluffball.speak()); // 'Meow, my name is Fluffball!'
```


## Save your model in the database

This item is not yet saved in the database. To save it, we need to create an [entity manager](/docs/guide/managers/entityManager) for the `Kitten` model.

```ts
const KittenManager = FirstTableManager.entityManager(Kitten);
```

Now that we have a kitten and a manager, we can save it in the database.

```ts
await KittenManager.put(fluffball);
```

## Fetch your model from the database

You can also use the [`get` method](/docs/guide/managers/entityManager#entitymanagergetprimarykey-options) to fetch the kitten from the database.
```ts
const fluffball = await KittenManager.get({ pk: 'kitten', sk: 'fluffball' });
```

Say time goes by and we want to display all the kittens we've seen. We can access all of the kittens we've seen by using the [`query` method](/docs/guide/query).

```ts
const data = await KittenManager.query().partitionKey('pk').eq('kitten').run();
```

You can also add filters to your query if you want to query all kittens with name that begins with 'fluff'.

```ts
const data = await KittenManager.query().partitionKey('pk').eq('kitten').sortKey('sk').beginsWith('fluff').run();
```

## Congratulations!

That's the end of our quick start. We connected to a DynamoDB instance, created a table and a model, added a custom method to a model, saved and queried kittens in DynamoDB using Dynamode.

Now, head over to the [guide](/docs/guide/entity/modeling) for more info on how to model your data with Dynamode!
